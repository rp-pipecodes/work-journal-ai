/**
 * Which window may ask for what, checked. A capability grants a list of
 * permissions to a list of windows by name, and nothing in the build objects
 * when one widens: `cargo build` resolves whether every permission named exists,
 * never who ended up holding it. A permission that reaches a window it was
 * never meant for is silent — no error, no failed build, and no symptom until
 * that window does something it should not have been able to do.
 *
 * The two resident panels are the ones to watch. Capture and Task Creation are
 * built at startup and only ever shown and hidden — see
 * docs/adr/0002-capture-window-is-hidden-never-closed.md — so anything granted
 * to them is held for the whole life of the app by a window with no screen to
 * report on it. Installing a release and ending the process to run it belong to
 * the Main Window alone: it is the window the user is looking at when they ask
 * for either, and the only one that can say how it went. See
 * docs/adr/0030-the-app-updates-itself-from-its-own-releases.md.
