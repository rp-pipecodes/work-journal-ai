/**
 * Review Material: the Filter's Notes and the work completed in the Filter's
 * days as one lossless Markdown document — the third lossless rendering,
 * beside the Digest and Standup Material. It embeds the Filter's Digest
 * verbatim and adds a Completed section, so the two can never disagree about
 * the Filter's Notes. See `CONTEXT.md` and
 * docs/adr/0034-review-material-is-a-third-lossless-rendering.md.
 *
 * Retrospective only: completed Tasks and completed Task Occurrences, never
 * Open Tasks — that axis belongs to Standup Material. No model call, no
 * network, no waiting; the prose written from this document is #162's Review
 * Brief.
 *
 * Selection is explicit and deterministic: Notes stay in Digest order, and
 * completions — both record types as one set — run oldest-first with a stable
 * ID tie-break, via the shared `mergeCompletions`.
