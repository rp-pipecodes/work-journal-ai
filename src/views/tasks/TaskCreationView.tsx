/**
 * One line, one keystroke — a Task rather than a Note — and, if the user wants
 * one, the day it is meant to be done on. The window behind this view is
 * created at startup and only ever shown and hidden, and it is its own window
 * rather than a mode of the capture one so that an unfinished Capture and an
 * unfinished Task Creation can both be sitting there at once; see
 * docs/adr/0019-task-creation-has-its-own-resident-window.md.
 *
 * Scheduled For is optional and explicit. The description is committed
 * verbatim whatever it says — a line reading "tomorrow at 9" schedules
 * nothing, because nothing here reads it for meaning.
 *
 * The field is reset when a Task Creation *ends* rather than when one begins:
 * an Entry Point reached while the window is already up focuses it and changes
 * nothing, so what was typed survives being asked for again, and Escape or a
 * commit is what leaves the next one empty.
 *
 * Nothing here is rendered into a portal, and nothing here may be: the window
 * is transparent, undecorated and only as tall as this view asks for, so
 * anything drawn outside the panel is clipped by the window's own edge.
