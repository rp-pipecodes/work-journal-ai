/**
 * The Main Window's sidebar: every section, with the one showing marked.
 *
 * It carries the window's title bar strip because the traffic lights are
 * overlaid on the window's top-left corner, which is over the sidebar — see
 * `WindowTitleBar`. The section beside it keeps a strip of its own, which is
 * what levels its first row with this one.
 *
 * Keyboard: ordinary buttons, so Tab reaches them in the order they are listed
 * and Enter or Space chooses one. Nothing here rebinds the arrow keys — a
 * sidebar of a few named places is a list of links, not a grid to steer around.
