/**
 * The one window the journal is read in: a sidebar of sections down the left,
 * exactly one of them showing — see
 * docs/adr/0022-one-main-window-for-reading-and-settings.md.
 *
 * The window is built when it is asked for and genuinely closed on dismiss, so
 * everything here starts fresh with it. Which section it starts on is the
 * Entry Point's to say: the Tray Menu and a clicked Task Alert each name one,
 * and a request naming none resolves to History.
 *
 * Every section stays mounted and only the one showing is on screen. A section
 * is a place the user keeps coming back to rather than a page they load: a
 * Filter narrowed in History, or a Task half-edited, survives a trip to the
 * other section — and a Nudge raised while the other one is showing waits
 * quietly on History rather than being announced from the sidebar.
 *
 * A section knows nothing about the sidebar. Every section is rendered exactly
 * as it was when each had a window to itself, which is also how they are still
 * tested. The one thing they are told is whether they are on screen — see
 * `on-screen-context` — because hiding a section hides only what it holds, and
 * a dialog it portalled out of the document stays on screen without it.
 *
 * Onboarding is a temporary guided flow shown in place of the sections while
 * it runs — see docs/onboarding.md. It appears on its own when a fresh
 * installation is still due, and when Settings asks to replay it. While it is
 * up the sections stay mounted and hidden exactly as they do when another
 * section is showing, so leaving the flow — Finish, Skip onboarding, or a
 * sidebar choice — returns to the section that was there. Leaving it is also
 * what dismisses automatic presentation: a fresh installation is offered the
 * introduction until it is finished, skipped, closed, quit out of, or left by
 * navigating away, and manual replay from Settings never re-enables any of
 * that.
