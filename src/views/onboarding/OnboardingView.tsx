 * shows the Hotkeys that actually apply, and offers the optional setup the
 * running build has. Each step's choices are saved the moment they are made
 * and kept in this view for the life of the window, so Back shows what the
 * user just chose and replay shows what was saved before. Nothing here is a
 * second owner of any setting: the controls reach the same `AppSettings` the
 * Settings section does.
 *
 * The flow is a short walk over an ordered list rather than a fixed screen:
 * the introduction and optional practice → Start at Login → Meeting Import →
 * Model Access → Finish in History, each step skippable on its own without
 * the flow growing or the walk getting stuck.
