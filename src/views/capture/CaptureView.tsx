 * being shown, since the window is also put away to make room for Task
 * Creation with a Body still half-typed in it.
 *
 * While a Project Marker is open, Predictions drawn from Projects already on
 * Notes sit under the field. Choosing one fills the marker; typing a new name
 * and committing still works with no list required.
