/**
 * The preferences a Work Summary is written under, as the user's — plain
 * text in the settings file beside the rest, because a prompt is voice rather
 * than a secret. It lives here rather than beside the summary it produced:
 * editing a prompt next to one week's summary invites tuning it against that
 * week, which is how you end up with a prompt that only works on Tuesdays.
 *
 * Voice and structure only: which records a summary describes is the
 * section's selection, and no customization here redefines it or turns an
 * inference into a recorded fact.
 *
 * Empty means the default, not silence. A cleared field is written as the
 * empty string, `readSettings` reads it back as the shipped prompt, and a
 * model is never asked under an empty system prompt — see issue #133.
