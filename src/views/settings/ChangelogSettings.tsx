/**
 * What every version changed, from the changelog this build shipped with —
 * asked for whenever the user wants it, rather than only in the moment an
 * update was found. The version running is the one on screen without a press,
 * because "what did the app I have just been given do?" is the question this
 * group exists for; everything before it is a press away.
 *
 * Not a session and not a setting: the disclosure is the state of this view's
 * own control, which is where React keeps it. See
 * docs/adr/0025-a-session-is-for-sequencing-not-for-state.md.
