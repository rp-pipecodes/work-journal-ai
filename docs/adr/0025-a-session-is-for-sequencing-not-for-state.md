# A session is for sequencing, not for state

Four surfaces in the app are headless sessions — History, Tasks View, the sweep, the tray count — and the shape is good enough that its absence started to read as a defect. It is not. A session earns its interface by holding **sequencing**: which of two overlapping reads may reach the screen, what a change re-reads, what a failure leaves behind, what happens in which order. A surface that holds only the value of its own controls is a view, and it keeps its state in React where it already lives.

Settings, the Capture window and the Task Creation window are views. They stay views.

## Considered options

- **A session per surface, for symmetry.** Rejected. `SettingsView` is form state with optimistic writes: every handler sets a value, writes it, and puts the old one back if the write fails. There is one read on mount, one focus listener, one close listener, and one derived rule — Import shows as the user's wish less whatever macOS is withholding — which already has tests. A session would restate `useState` as fields on a hand-rolled observable and gain nothing that could be asserted afterwards which cannot be asserted now.
- **A session for the two resident panels**, on the grounds that a commit is four ordered steps with three failure policies. Rejected: four awaits in one function, each carrying the comment that says why, is where that sequence is clearest. The rules underneath it — `decideKeystroke`, `markerPrefix`, `applyPrediction`, `askAboutTaskAlerts` — are extracted and tested already, which is the part that was worth extracting.
- **Counting `useState` and `useEffect` as the test.** Rejected as the trap that produced this ADR. `SettingsView` has fourteen and five; `HistoryView` has fewer of both and needs its session badly. The number says how many controls a view has, not how much order there is to get wrong.

## Consequences

- **The question to ask about a new surface is what it sequences, not how big it is.** If the answer is "nothing — it shows values and writes them back", it is a view.
- **A rule shared by two surfaces is extracted on its own, not by giving each of them a session.** `src/journal/task-alerts.ts` is the example: one function, one rule, used by the Task Creation window, the Task Editor and Settings, and it settled that question without any of the three changing shape.
- **A view is still tested through the DOM, and that is not a failure.** `SettingsView.test.tsx` presses controls because what a control reads and what pressing it means are genuinely decided in the view. Fifteen tests over jsdom is the right cost for that; moving them to Node would mean inventing an interface for them to cross.
- **Sessions stay rare enough to mean something.** Four is the count because four surfaces have sequencing worth naming. A fifth should have to argue for itself the same way.
- **This does not defend view size.** `SettingsView` is 842 lines and most of it is markup. If it becomes hard to read, the answer is more sub-components in the same file or beside it — not a module behind an interface.
